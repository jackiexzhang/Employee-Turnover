# Employee-Turnover


We were interested in determining which attributes strongly influenced employee turnover. In order to do so, we utilized survival analysis modeling and BIC as a criterion for model selection. To further explore the personality attributes unique to this data set, we used machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Clustering to determine if certain personality traits had an effect on the individual choosing to quit their job.
